Aim

To implement client-side routing in a React application using React Router.

Overview

This experiment demonstrates how React Router enables navigation between multiple pages without reloading the browser. It uses routes and links to switch between Home, About, and Contact pages.

Tools & Technologies Used

React

Vite

React Router DOM

JavaScript (JSX)

Components Used

BrowserRouter – Wraps the application to enable routing

Routes – Holds all route definitions

Route – Maps URL paths to components

Link – Used for navigation without page reload

Pages Created

Home Page

About Page

Contact Page

Description

A navigation bar is created using Link components

Clicking on a link updates the URL

Corresponding page content is rendered dynamically

Page reload is avoided due to client-side routing

Steps Performed

Created a React project using Vite

Installed react-router-dom

Created page components (Home, About, Contact)

Added navigation using Link

Defined routes using Routes and Route

Output

A working navigation bar

Smooth page transitions without reload

URL changes based on selected route

Learning Outcomes

Understood client-side routing in React

Learned how to use React Router components

Improved understanding of single-page applications (SPA)

Gained experience with navigation handling

Conclusion

React Router provides an efficient way to manage navigation in React applications. This experiment helped in understanding routing concepts and building multi-page SPAs.
