Aim

To create and run a basic React application using Vite and understand its fast development environment with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

Overview

This experiment demonstrates how Vite is used as a modern build tool to set up a React project quickly with minimal configuration and fast reloads.

Tools & Technologies Used

Vite

React

JavaScript (JSX)

Node.js

npm

Steps Performed

Created a new Vite project using React template

Installed required dependencies

Modified the default App.jsx file

Used useState hook for counter functionality

Ran the project on local development server

Code Description

useState is used to manage the counter state

Clicking the button increases the count value

Vite and React logos link to their official documentation

HMR allows instant UI updates without page reload

Output

A working React app running on Vite

Button click updates counter value dynamically

Fast reload on code changes

Learning Outcomes

Understood Vite project structure

Learned how to use React hooks

Experienced fast build and reload with Vite

Gained hands-on practice with JSX

Conclusion

Vite provides a fast and efficient development environment for React applications. This experiment helped in understanding basic React components, hooks, and modern frontend tooling.
